In this research we review and analyze the historical prices of crops in the province of Manitoba from 1988 - 2022. 
The research is in two phases. One phase is analyzing the historical prices along fertilizer prices and the correlation between 
Prices and how they affected the Canada and Manitoba Consumer Price Index (CPI). 
In the second phase we try to forecast the prices of crops using ML techniques. 
The techniques we used in this research are ARIMA, SARIMA, and LSTM.

Datasets are mostly from Bank of Canada, Statistics Canada, Government of Manitoba, International Monetary fund, and World bank. 
The Historical dataset of crop prices is from the Government of Manitoba website. (The dataset is open-access)
